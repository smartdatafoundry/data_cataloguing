The variables were collected from The Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD), The Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation (WIMD) & The English Index of Deprivation (EID). Variables include public and private transport travel times to the nearest general practice, private transport travel times and road distances to the nearest primary school, and road distances to the nearest general practice."
